// Centralize all icon imports to reduce bundle splitting
export {
  MdSchedule,
  MdClose,
  MdDateRange,
  MdEdit,
  MdDirectionsCarFilled,
} from "react-icons/md";

export { HiSearch, HiLocationMarker } from "react-icons/hi";

// Alternative: Consider switching to a smaller icon library like Lucide React
// import { Search, MapPin, Calendar, Edit, X, Clock, Car } from "lucide-react";
// Much smaller bundle size (~2KB vs react-icons ~200KB+)
